# Sudoku-Solver-With-BackTracking
Implementation of a visual sudoku solver with backtracking.
It works really well, but it took me about 2-3 hours more than it should have because my rows and columns were in the wrong direction in different functions, sometimes rows represented x, and other times it represented y. This was due to me calling the wrong function for row right in the beginning.
